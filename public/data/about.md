I'm a full-stack and AI developer focused on building real-world, useful applications.

My experience includes working with Flask, LangChain, React, and vector search to create tools like a Smart Email Assistant and an AI-powered Glaucoma Screening System.

I enjoy bridging AI and product thinking making things that not only work but actually help people. Whether it's backend logic or frontend usability, I aim to build clean, efficient solutions.

Pursuing a degree in AI/ML Engineering and actively working on expanding my skills through internships, personal projects, and open-source contributions.
